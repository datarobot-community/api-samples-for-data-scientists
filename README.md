# Welcome to Using R & Python with DataRobot!

This page will help you get started with using the “datarobot” R and Python packages to interact with DataRobot. You can import data, build models, evaluate metrics, and make predictions right from the console.  

**There are several advantages to interacting with DataRobot programmatically:**

1. You can set up a series of tasks and walk away while DataRobot and R/Python do the rest. 
2. You can get more customized analyses by combining the power of R/Python with the various outputs you can get from DataRobot. 
3. You can more easily reproduce prior results with code.

You can find the full documentation of the datarobot R package [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datarobot/datarobot.pdf). 

You can find the full documentation of the datarobot Python package [here](https://datarobot-public-api-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/).
