Additionally, prediction intervals are not available when the number of points per forecast distance is less than 10, due to insufficient data.\n",

Larger values are less precise, but more conservative. For example, specifying a size of 80 will result in a lower bound of 10% and an upper bound of 90%. More generally, for a specific <code>prediction_intervals_size</code>, the upper and lower bounds will be calculated as follows:\n",
    "<ul>\n",

    "</ul>\n",
    "To view prediction intervals data for a prediction, the prediction needs to have been created using <code>request_predictions</code> and specifying <code>include_prediction_intervals = True</code>. The size for the prediction interval can be specified with the <code>prediction_intervals_size</code> parameter for the same function, and will default to 80 if left unspecified. Specifying these fields will result in prediction interval bounds being included in the retrieved prediction data for that request. See <code>request_predictions</code> for more details."
